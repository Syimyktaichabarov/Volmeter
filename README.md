# Volmeter
Main goal of this project is to show to u volt of some electrical thing

There is will two tweezers, by them u will touch some electrical thing that u want, after they LCD will show how many volt have thing that u toucing. There is one thing u must to know it will show only volt from 0 to 30. In another way on screen will just nothing.How u can see in image under arduino was 2 resistor (R1,R2) After when will print all of thing u can just connect tweezers to wires from this 2 resistor. Hole in cap of cover is 2.5 mm (diameter). 
Connections between lcd display and arduino board:
* R1 100kohm Resistor
* R2 10kohm Resistor

-LCD D5 pin to digital pin 5
- LCD D6 pin to digital pin 6
- LCD D7 pin to digital pin 7
- LCD RS pin to digital pin 2
- LCD Enable pin to digital pin 3
- LCD D4 pin to digital pin 4
- LCD R/W pin to ground
- LCD VSS pin to ground
- LCD VCC pin to 5V
- 10K resistor:
- ends to +5V and ground
- wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
